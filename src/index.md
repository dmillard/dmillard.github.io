I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California,
advised by [Gaurav Sukhatme](http://www-robotics.usc.edu/~gaurav/).  I am funded
by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship.

My goal is to create Robots of Economic Value that Don't Make the World Worse
(REVDMWWs).

### Condensed history

In 2020, I was a research intern at [Google
Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), working on high inductive bias
methods of robot learning.

In 2019, I worked with [Iron Ox](https://ironox.com) on kinodynamically limited
arm planning problems using trajectory optimization methods.

From 2015 to 2018, I was a software engineer at
[Google&nbsp;X](https://x.company) working on robotics.

From 2014 to 2015, I was a software engineer at Microsoft.

I graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2014 with a B.S. in mathematics and computer
science from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu), where I studied
under the auspices of the [Foundation
Fellowship](https://honors.uga.edu/c_s/scholarships/f_f/foundation_fellows.html).

In July 2013, I worked in Khayelitsha, South Africa, collaborating with the
[Schools Improvement Initiative](http://www.sii.uct.ac.za) at the University of
Cape Town to repair and improve computer labs at primary and secondary schools
through free software and open knowledge bases, like Wikipedia.

From May to August 2012, I researched multiagent mapping systems in the Computer
Networks and Telematics Group at the University of Freiburg, in Freiburg,
Germany.

In 2012 and 2013, I served as president of [UGA Mathcounts
Outreach](//ugamathcounts.com).

From 2009 to 2013, I was a staff member of [Free IT
Athens](//www.freeitathens.org).
